<h2>
    How to Add 
    a Custom Search Provider in IE9 and Make it Default</h2>
<p>
    To add a 
    custom search provider:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Open an IE9 web brower</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Enter
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/en-en/default.mspx">
            http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/en-en/default.mspx</a> in the 
            address bar
            
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If the provider you want is listed under Web Search, just click its name</p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When you click on the link, a new page opens with a list of compatible search providers.
            Browse to the one you want to add (in this case, Google) and click on the button
            that says <strong>Add to Internet Explorer</strong></p>
        <p>
        </p>
</ol>
<p>
    Once you click on <strong>Add to Internet Explorer</strong>, another dialog box
    appears asking if you want to make it your default search provider. If you wish
    to add Google as search provider and make it default, select the option. Click <strong>
        Add</strong> and close the add-ons page.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The new search provider will not appear in the <strong>Manage
        Add-ons</strong> window that is open. To view it, close and re-open it.</p>
