    If you're wanting to experiment with some dummy data, maybe you want to play around
    with some styles, or formatting. Or you might want to figure out how to use outlining.
    In both cases, you don't want to have to type all of the text yourself. Well, you

<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>=rand(x)</strong> and press enter <em>(where x is the
        nunber of paragraphs of text that you want)</em></p>
<p>
    If you'd typed:</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>=rand(10)</strong> and pressed enter</p>

    that you specify directly.</p>
